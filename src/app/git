Getting Started With Git:


Git Is version control Tools means manage a project .
- we need to install git and set path in envirnment.
- It's very use full in project when you are working in team.
basic start:

    you have account on GitHub.com 
    first create account in github .
    In GitHub portal there are 2 facilities for creating account and managing project.
    - if you are student then you create public repository n in this create your own
    repository. 
    - after creating repository you have to copy the path of that repository.

    open a command prompt and type the below command

     git remote add remote origin //past name here of your repository.

    git add remote origin https://github.com/kiranlasure/metro-menia.git
    
     then After that suppose we make some changes in your project then you can push your project in git 
     using below command

     git push origin master 


    --VIP suppose we want to see what changes made from previous changes to now use below command

    git diff

    If you want to add changes made by you to in staging area then use below command (the difference between push and add is we add code locally and in push we push you code on server)

    git add .

    N finaly the commit command in your project you want to save all changes then use below command

    git commit -m " msg"

    in above command msg is a message to the developer who n what changes are done in this repository

    If You want see what changes are done in project like added component, deleted files then use below command

    git status

    If Accidently you delete any file in you project then we can restore this using 

    restore command
    git restore  src/app/apicall2/apicall2.component.ts

    in above example the file will be restored
